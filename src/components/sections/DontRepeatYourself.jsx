        Remember how we made our{" "}
        <span>
          <a className="styled-link inline-link" href="#breakpoints">
            container widths divisible by 12
          </a>
        </span>
        ? Well, to have 12 columns, we'd need 12{" "}
        <code className="inline">1fr</code>, like so:
      </p>
      <p className="centered-text">
        <code className="inline">
          grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't ideal as it's a pain to write that all out, and it's not easy
        to understand how many columns you've got in your grid at a glance.
        Thankfully, you can just <code className="inline">repeat</code>{" "}
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p className="centered-text">
        <code className="inline">grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr)</code>
      </p>

      <TwelveColumnGrid />
    </section>
  );
}
